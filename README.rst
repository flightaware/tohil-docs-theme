Tohil Docs Sphinx Theme
=========================

This is the theme for the Tohil documentation, heavily heavily based on
the theme for the Python documentation at https://github.com/python/python-docs-theme.

To use the theme, install it into your docs build environment via ``pip`` 
(preferably in a virtual environment).


Configuration options
---------------------

To use this theme, add the following to ``conf.py``:

- ``html_theme = 'tohil_docs_theme'``

- ``html_sidebars``, defaults taken from http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/config.html#confval-html_sidebars

But really you probably want to start with this or the Python theme or whatever, and
change the theme.conf, etc.
